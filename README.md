# Machine Learning with Kernels Demo

I put this notebook together as an expository demonstration of many machine learning concepts. All the modeling is performed on Sir R. A. Fisher's infamous Iris dataset (Fisher, R.A. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems",  Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in "Contributions to  Mathematical Statistics" (John Wiley, NY, 1950)). Using this dataset, the following concepts are discussed / demonstrated:

- Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
- Feature Engineering
- Supervised Classification Modeling
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces
- Cross-Validation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Feature Selection
- Ensemble Modeling

Each new topic builds upon the previous topic, putting together a somewhat complete (conceptually) machine learning model fitting & evaluation process.
